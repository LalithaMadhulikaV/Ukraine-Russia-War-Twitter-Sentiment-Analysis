# Ukraine-Russia-War-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

The conflict between Ukraine and Russia is one of the hottest topics on social media since February 24, 2022. Throughout this conflict, millions of tweets were generated every day on Twitter. I want to use NLP techniques to help  understand peopleâ€™s opinions towards this conflict. In this project, I analyzed sentimental trends and conducted topic modeling based on a daily updated tweets dataset. I used the [Russia vs Ukraine Tweets Dataset(Daily Updated)](https://www.kaggle.com/towhidultonmoy/russia-vs-ukraine-tweets-datasetdaily-updated) from Kaggle.

There are a lot of tweets about the Ukraine and Russia war where people tend to update about the ground truths, what they feel about it, and who they are supporting. I used those tweets for the task of Twitter sentiment analysis on the Ukraine and Russia war.
